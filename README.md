# ObjectiveTracker
An objective tracking Android app

I'm still learning to handle the branches and version control, so it will be messy at first, and hopefully more organized later. 

The purpose of this app is to create an alternative calendar for gamers. It will allow tasks to be created for your characters in various games, and will be able to organize by game and character. You will be able to track and untrack tasks, as well as put deadlines on them. It will also push notifications to your phone and your Android Wear device.
